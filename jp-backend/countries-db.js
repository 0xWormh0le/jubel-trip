      'When you hear the word Mexico, images of American tourist holidays like weekends in Cancun and parties in Cabo might come to mind. Peel back the layers of this facade and be met with heart, soul, and spice. A vivid culture with deep-rooted traditions, eclectic cities, and spectacular physical diversity, the Mexicans are known as vivacious city folk, friendly small-town villagers, and welcoming hosts. Mexico is a patchwork quilt of landscapes - golden beaches, snow-capped mountains, old colonial “magic” towns, muggy rainforests, and deserts that set the scene for colorful street food, equally colorful folk-art traditions, outdoor adventure, exploration of cultural and historical treasures, and pure relaxation.\n' +

      'Food in Mexico is fiery - a true burst of flavor that targets all your taste buds. Darting from region to region, you’ll come across a creative gastronomy that includes the likes of birria (stew with chili and spices) in Guadalajara, arroz con leche (rice pudding) in the Bajio region, and tropical salsas in Yucatan cooking. At the same time, the great outdoors awakens the senses. The smell of secluded sandy beaches and salty sea in Tulum, the feeling of being microscopic among massive pyramids in Teotihuacan, the sounds of the rainforest in Chiapas, and the spectacle of a million fluttering Monarch butterflies in Michoacan; Mexico is a place for exploration. Although Mexico has a reputation for being unsafe, it is no more dangerous than most other tourist hotspots around the world - just be a smart traveler.',

      'You care about history, culture and music, fashion and design, a great selection of local food, and a similarly rich display of natural beauty? Look no further than Sweden and rest assured that Scandinavia’s largest country has it all and plenty of it!\n' +

      'Whether you look to Sweden’s viking past (combined with sugar-sand beaches) as you explore the island of Gotland, or delve into the longstanding tradition of lively midsummer celebrations — Swedes are known for their hospitality which will help you discover even the most secluded parts of this all-round fascinating country. \n' +

      'With a great selection of energetic cities, the eastern capital of Stockholm belongs on your list of must-see places. Built over fourteen islands, this vibrant harbor city features a well-preserved historic core but is mostly known for its dynamic, modern and liberal flair. But it is not only the country’s innovative design and constant progress that garner some well-deserved attention around the world. Sweden’s vast and untouched nature creates a stunning counterpart, with thousands of islands and inland lakes framing the country’s colorful coastline. \n' +

      'Much like its neighbor Norway, Sweden’s “allemansrätten” gives you the freedom to roam. Where, you wonder? Graced with nearly 100,000 lakes, lush forests, rolling fields, impressive mountain ranges, and some of the best locations to marvel at the Northern lights, Sweden won’t leave you short of possibilities. No matter the time of the year: An endless list of activities changes along with the different seasons while the Swedes’ love for saunas makes even the darkest and coldest days of winter enjoyable — especially if they are spent in good company.',
